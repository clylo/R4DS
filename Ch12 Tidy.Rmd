title: "Ch12 Tidy Data"
output: html_notebook
---

This is an [R Markdown](http://rmarkdown.rstudio.com) Notebook. When you execute code within the notebook, the results appear beneath the code. 

Try executing this chunk by clicking the *Run* button within the chunk or by placing your cursor inside it and pressing *Ctrl+Shift+Enter*. 

```{r}
plot(cars)
```

Add a new chunk by clicking the *Insert Chunk* button on the toolbar or by pressing *Ctrl+Alt+I*.

When you save the notebook, an HTML file containing the code and output will be saved alongside it (click the *Preview* button or press *Ctrl+Shift+K* to preview the HTML file).

The preview shows you a rendered HTML copy of the contents of the editor. Consequently, unlike *Knit*, *Preview* does not run any R code chunks. Instead, the output of the chunk when it was last run in the editor is displayed.
```{r}
library(tidyverse)
table1
```

the three golden rules of tidy data
each variable is its own column
each observation is its own row
each value is its own cell

1. guessing t1 is the tidy data, 
2.Compute the rate for table2, and table4a + table4b. You will need to perform four operations:

Extract the number of TB cases per country per year.
Extract the matching population per country per year.
Divide cases by population, and multiply by 10000.
Store back in the appropriate place.
Which representation is easiest to work with? Which is hardest? Why?
```{r}
table2

t2_cases <- filter(table2, type == "cases") %>%
  rename(cases = count) %>%
  arrange(country, year)
t2_cases

t2_population <- filter(table2, type == "population")%>%
  rename(population = count) %>%
  arrange(country, year)

t2_cases_per_cap <- t2_cases %>%
  mutate(population = t2_population$population,
         cases_per_cap = (cases / population) * 10000) %>%
  select(country, year, cases_per_cap)
t2_cases_per_cap

t2_cases_per_cap <- t2_cases_per_cap %>%
  mutate(type = "cases_per_cap") %>%
  rename(count = cases_per_cap)

bind_rows(table2, t2_cases_per_cap) %>%
  arrange(country, year, type, count)

```
```{r}
#table4a is count of tb cases
#table4b is pop
table4c <- tibble(country = table4a$country,
                  `1999` = table4a[['1999']]*10^4/table4b[['1999']],
                  `2000` = table4a[['2000']]*10^4/table4b[['2000']]
                  )
table4c
```

3.
```{r}
table2 %>% 
  filter(type == 'cases') %>% 
  ggplot(aes(year, count))+
  geom_line(aes(group = country), color = 'grey50')+
  geom_point(aes(color = country))

```

12.3.3
1.
```{r}
stocks <- tibble(
  year   = c(2015, 2015, 2016, 2016),
  half  = c(   1,    2,     1,    2),
  return = c(1.88, 0.59, 0.92, 0.17)
)
stocks

stocks %>% 
  spread(year, return) %>% 
  gather("year", "return", `2015`:`2016`)
```
year turned into a character after being spread and gathered, guessing this is because of coercion info is lost 

using convert can keep the column info

2.

```{r}
table4a
table4a %>% 
  gather(-country, key = "year", value = "cases")
table4a %>% 
  gather(1999, 2000, key = "year", value = "cases")
```

Fails to gather because the country var col is still there

3.
```{r}
people <- tribble(
  ~name,             ~key,    ~value,
  #-----------------|--------|------
  "Phillip Woods",   "age",       45,
  "Phillip Woods",   "height",   186,
  "Phillip Woods",   "age",       50,
  "Jessica Cordero", "age",       37,
  "Jessica Cordero", "height",   156
)
```
fails to spread properly because phil woods has two ages and two vals for each age

12.4.3
1.
```{r}
tibble(x = c("a,b,c", "d,e,f,g", "h,i,j")) %>% 
  separate(x, c("one", "two", "three"), fill = 'left', extra = 'drop')

tibble(x = c("a,b,c", "d,e", "f,g,i")) %>% 
  separate(x, c("one", "two", "three"), fill = 'right')
```

2.
If TRUE, remove input column from output data frame.

set it to false if you want to keep the original vector

3.
different types of delimiters but only one method of concatenation
