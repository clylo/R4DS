title: "CH20 Vectors"
output: html_notebook
---

This is an [R Markdown](http://rmarkdown.rstudio.com) Notebook. When you execute code within the notebook, the results appear beneath the code. 

Try executing this chunk by clicking the *Run* button within the chunk or by placing your cursor inside it and pressing *Ctrl+Shift+Enter*. 

```{r}
plot(cars)
```

Add a new chunk by clicking the *Insert Chunk* button on the toolbar or by pressing *Ctrl+Alt+I*.

When you save the notebook, an HTML file containing the code and output will be saved alongside it (click the *Preview* button or press *Ctrl+Shift+K* to preview the HTML file).

The preview shows you a rendered HTML copy of the contents of the editor. Consequently, unlike *Knit*, *Preview* does not run any R code chunks. Instead, the output of the chunk when it was last run in the editor is displayed.

```{r}
!is.infinite(Inf)
```
Is it infinite, return boolean and ! makes it the opposite, is it not infinite?

```{r}
library(dplyr)
```
```{r}
near(5+5,10)
```
See if two numeric vectors are equal

```{r}
near
```
Brainstorm at least four functions that allow you to convert a double to an integer. How do they differ? Be precise.

```{r}
as.integer(10.11111)
```

What functions from the readr package allow you to turn a string into logical, integer, and double vector?
parse_logical
parse_integer
parse_number

```{r}

```

20.4.6 Exercises
What does mean(is.na(x)) tell you about a vector x? What about sum(!is.finite(x))?
```{r}
mean(is.na(c(10,10,10,NA)))
```
The number 1 out of 4 in the vector is NA
```{r}
sum(!is.infinite(c(10,10,10,NA)))
```
4 elements in the vector is not Inf

Carefully read the documentation of is.vector(). What does it actually test for? Why does is.atomic() not agree with the definition of atomic vectors above?
```{r}

```

Compare and contrast setNames() with purrr::set_names().
```{r}
setNames(c(10,10,10,10), nm = c("a","b","c","d"))
```

Create functions that take a vector as input and returns:

The last value. Should you use [ or [[?
```{r}
last <- function(x){
  x[length(x)]
}
```
```{r}
last(c(1,2,3))
```

The elements at even numbered positions.
```{r}
even <- function(x){
  x[seq_along(x) %% 2 == 0)]
}
```
```{r}
even(c(3,3,3,4,5))
```

Every element except the last value.
```{r}
notlast <- function(x){
  x[-length(x)]
}
```
```{r}
notlast(c(1,2,3,4))
```

Only even numbers (and no missing values).
```{r}
evenposition <- function(x){
  x[rep(x %%2 ==0)]
}
```
```{r}
evenposition(c(2,4,5,3,8,10))
```

Why is x[-which(x > 0)] not the same as x[x <= 0]?
```{r}
z <- c(2,-3,0,-5,5)
z[z <= 0]

z[-which(z > 0)]
```
first one says index z where z is less equal to zero

second says index those which z are less than 0

What happens when you subset with a positive integer that's bigger than the length of the vector? What happens when you subset with a name that doesn't exist?

```{r}
y <- c(1,10)
#length of vector is two

#subset with position 3
y[3]
```
brings up an NA,


Draw the following lists as nested sets:

list(a, b, list(c, d), list(e, f))
list(list(list(list(list(list(a))))))

What happens if you subset a tibble as if you're subsetting a list? What are the key differences between a list and a tibble?
```{r}
tibble::tibble(x = 1:5, y = x ^ 2)
```
```{r}
randlist <- list(1,list(1,2,3),list(list(123,123)))
randlist
```

```{r}

```
subetting tibbles is the same as a list and a tibble can even be thought as like columns of lists which all have the same length.

20.7.4 Exercises
What does hms::hms(3600) return? How does it print? What primitive type is the augmented vector built on top of? What attributes does it use?
```{r}
hms::hms(3600)
typeof(hms::hms(3600))
print(hms::hms(3600))
```
Is a double type. The primitive type built on top of it is

Try and make a tibble that has columns with different lengths. What happens?
```{r}
tibble::tibble(x=list(1,2,3), y=list(1,2))
```
cant make it cuz the lengths are different

Based on the definition above, is it ok to have a list as a column of a tibble?
Yes but it has to be the same lengths really
