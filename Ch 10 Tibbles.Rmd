title: "Ch 10 Tibbles"
output: html_notebook

This is an [R Markdown](http://rmarkdown.rstudio.com) Notebook. When you execute code within the notebook, the results appear beneath the code. 

Try executing this chunk by clicking the *Run* button within the chunk or by placing your cursor inside it and pressing *Ctrl+Shift+Enter*. 

```{r}
plot(cars)
```

Add a new chunk by clicking the *Insert Chunk* button on the toolbar or by pressing *Ctrl+Alt+I*.

When you save the notebook, an HTML file containing the code and output will be saved alongside it (click the *Preview* button or press *Ctrl+Shift+K* to preview the HTML file).

The preview shows you a rendered HTML copy of the contents of the editor. Consequently, unlike *Knit*, *Preview* does not run any R code chunks. Instead, the output of the chunk when it was last run in the editor is displayed.


```{r}
library(tidyverse)

head(iris)

as.tibble(iris)

tibble(
  x = 1:5, 
  y = 1, 
  z = x ^ 2 + y
)
```

10.5
1. the col come up with dtype and fit to the screen
```{r}
class(iris)

head(mtcars)
```

2.

```{r}
df <- data.frame(abc = 1, xyz = "a")
df$x
df[, "xyz"]
df[, c("abc", "xyz")]
```

Displays differently. tibble shows as a table which we expect unlike the df which shows levels

3.  
```{r}
var <- "mpg"
select(mtcars, var)
```

4.
```{r}
annoying <- tibble(
  `1` = 1:10,
  `2` = `1` * 2 + rnorm(length(`1`))
)
```
```{r}
annoying
```
```{r}
annoying['1']
```
```{r}
ggplot(data = annoying, mapping = aes(x = `1`,y=  `2`))+
  geom_point()
#forgot to use backticks........lol
```
```{r}
mutate(annoying, new = `1`/`2`)
```
```{r}
rename(annoying,'one' = `1`, 'two' =`2`)
```

```{r}
?enframe
```
converts a vector to tibble when u have c(1,....)

6. width param in print func
